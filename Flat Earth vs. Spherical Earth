 <h4>I believe that the Earth is flat because of substantial evidence pointing in this direction which are fully supported by findings in math and philosophy. </h4>

<h3>Flat Earth </h3>
<p>
A person at a young age is told that the Earth is round and that is what they go onto believe for the rest of their lives. Their are several people who you can go up to and ask for their opinion and they are always able to give one but with no evidence. How is one able to pick a side without any factual evidence? Well people tend to believe most things they hear depending on if it comes from what they believe is a trusted source. In todays society if one were to refer to the earth as being flat they would be considered by their peers as ignorant or unintelligent. Surprisingly their are several science based facts that support both theories. This debate between the Earth being Spherical or Flat has been going on for thousands of years. The issue was huge among philosophers as they both could not wait to discover breakthroughs on the subject. It is quite fascinating that two thousand years plus since the first claims it is still an ongoing debate in society. In society today many celebrities have got behind the idea of the earth being flat that influenced the minds of several people. The idea of flat Earth has become very relevant in the past few years as NBA star Kyrie Irving and Rapper B.o.B have stated their opinions which have influenced the youth into creating an opinion.
